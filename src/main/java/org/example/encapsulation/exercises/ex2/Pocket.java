//Create class Pocket.
//a) Add field "money", create constructor, getter and setter.
//b) Add verification for both getter and setter. Getter should result in returning as much
//money, as the user asked for. It should return 0 if money <= 10.
//c) Setter should not accept values below 0 and greater than 3000. It may print a message
//like â€žI don't have enough space in my pocket for as much money!"
