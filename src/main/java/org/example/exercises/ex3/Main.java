/*
Student Grades Management (OOP, Collections, Optionals)
Objective: Implement a grading system for students that uses collections to store student records, Optionals to handle empty grades, and Streams for data analysis.
Exercise Steps:
Create Classes:
Define a Student class with fields like id, name, age, and a Map<String, Double> to store subject grades.
Store Students:
Use a List<Student> to hold all student records.
Operations:
Get Grades: Create a method that, given a Student and a subject name, returns an Optional<Double> for the grade in that subject. If the subject doesnâ€™t exist, it should return Optional.empty().
Find: Use Streams to find students with an average grade above 85.
Sort: Sort students based on their average grade and then by name.
Calculate: Find the highest grade in each subject using Streams.
